## Top data structure concepts 

Arrays - A collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations, accessed using an index.

Linked lists - A data structure consisting of nodes linked together, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

Stacks - A data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element pushed into the stack is the first one to be popped out.

Queues - A data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

Trees - A data structure consisting of nodes linked together in a hierarchical structure, with a root node at the top and child nodes below.

Graphs - A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them, allowing for complex relationships between elements.

Hash tables - A data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values, allowing for efficient retrieval of data.

Heaps - A binary tree-based data structure that is typically used to implement priority queues.

Sets - A collection of unique elements, typically implemented using a hash table or a binary search tree.

Maps - A collection of key-value pairs, typically implemented using a hash table or a binary search tree.
